# Basic snippets to always include in AGENTS.md

## These should work regardless type of project and language

## General
```markdown
## General
- Follow the principle of **least surprise**: code should behave in a way that is consistent with developer expectations.
- Keep changes small and focused. If a change requires multiple steps, consider breaking it into separate commits.
```

## Documentation
```markdown
## Documentation
- Any feature or significant code change must be documented in `README.md`.
- Keep this `AGENTS.md` up to date if the development workflow changes.
```

## Todo
```markdown
## Todo
- Add new todo items directly in the code by using the @todo tag or add it to TODO.md whenever something is missed.

- Remove the item when it's implemented.
```

## Pull Requests
```markdown
## Pull Requests
